							<h3><b>Visualising geographical distribution of service complaints.  </b>                      
                            </h3>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								In the following we will be visualising the geographical distribution of service complaints within different categories. We will be looking at the development of this spatial distribution over years, months and hours, thereby investigating both the spatial and temporal development of the service complaints.
								<br>
								For this purpose we constructed a scatterplot taking the longitude and latitude of each service complaints and plotting these points on map of San Fransisco. When plotting observation we defined two different approaches:
								
							</p>	
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;">1. Sample a fixed number of complaints from each category.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;">2. Sample a fraction of complaints from each category.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">							

								The first approach allows solely for investigation of the development in spatial patterns in the categories over time, whereas the second approach allows us to investigate how the total number of complaints changes during the year, month and hour. Generally a scatterplot is not well suited for visualising count data, but when used in conjunction with the bar plot in part XX, the scatter plot allows us to investigate whether this changes in the total number of complaints is due to local or global changes in the geographical distribution of complaints.
							</p>
							<h2>Focus categories:                        
                            </h2>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								In this part we chose to focus on the categories "Graffiti", "Encampments" and "Tree Maintenance" out of the 101 different categories, to focus our analysis on a few relevant categories. We focused on these specific categories since they cover a diverse set of complaint types in the city of San Fransisco.								
							</p>
							<h2>Notice:                        
                            </h2>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								Due to constraints in upload capacity we were not able to upload the full scatterplots to the website. For that reason, we plot around 1500 fewer samples per category on the website compared to the notebook. For that reason, the highlighted patterns might not be as evident on the website as in the notebook. Please feel free to refer to the notebook for the full size visualisations.
							</p>
							<h3>Investigating yearly patterns</h3>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">

								Lets start by investigating the yearly pattern for the three categories...
								<br>
								<iframe width="950" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~mmestre/13.embed"></iframe>
								<br>
								Overall 'Encampments' and 'Graffiti' occurs mostly in the city center. Interestingly however, we see that both 'Graffiti' and 'Encampments' occur more often in the outer regions of the city in the early years of 2009-2011 compared to the later years 2018-2019. For instance, in the southern region of SF there is a cluster of 'Graffiti' complaints in the early years, which is almost completely dissolved by 2015.
								<br>
								Based on this development we can say that 'Graffiti' and 'Encampments' are most likely to occur in the city center of SF. Hence, future efforts to reduce the number of complaints for these categories should be geographically focused at the city center.
								<br>
								'Tree Maintenance' complaints are more evenly distributed across the city and remain so over the years. Hence, there is no clear change in the spatial pattern of this complaint type over the years.
								<br>
								Lets zoom in and investigate developments in the geographical distribution on a monthly basis.
							</p>
							<h3>Investigating monthly patterns                      
                            </h3>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								When investigating the barplot in part <b>XX</b> we noticed some kind of "beginning-of-year-effect" in the distribution of 'Graffity' complaints. Every January-February the amount of complaints increase suddenly and keep increasing throughout March-April after which the amount of complaints drop again until it reaches its low in December. This effect is particularly evident in the years 2016-2019, so we will focus on these years in the following.
								<br>
								Lets see if this trend is due to changes in local or global trends in the geographical distribution of complaints...
								<br>
								<iframe width="950" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~mmestre/19.embed"></iframe>
								<br>
								<b>Graffiti</b> in the plot we see that "beginning-of-year-effect" results in a global increase the number of complaints. We only see a small increase in local complaint count, for instance the southern area of the city where we just identified a cluster back in the previous section.
								<br>
								All in all, the spatial pattern is very similar and the overall increase in 'Graffiti' complaints is not driven by any local increase. Graffiti complaints are still most prevalent in the city center throughout the months of the year. Hence, to address the increase in the number of 'Graffiti', the city should implement initiatives focused on the city center.
								<br>
								Lets now zoom in once again and investigate the development in the geographical distribution over the hours of the day...
							</p>
							<h3>Investigating daily patterns                      
                            </h3>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">								
								<iframe width="950" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~mmestre/24.embed"></iframe>
								<br>
							</p>
							<h2>Overall development:                        
                            </h2>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								In the plot we see the daily cycle of the number of complaints for the categories of 'Graffiti' and 'Encampments'. We chose to focus on these categories after investigating the distribution of 'Tree Maintenance', where we found no interesting pattern. Additionally, this helps limit the size of the plot for efficient integration into the website.
								<br>					
								Overall, we see that during the first hours of the day (the night) there is few complaints in all categories. As we approach the 7:00 AM, and people start going to work, we see a steep increase in the number of complaints in all categories. From 7:00 until Noon the number of complaints keep increasing. As we approach 16:00-17:00 PM we see a large decrease in the number of complaints across all categories. By 11:00 PM the number of complaints is at a low point and stays there throughout the night.
								<br>
								This pattern, arising from the natural rythm of our society, is of cause to be expected.
								<br>
								When plotting the distribution of complaints over the hours for each category in the previous section, we found that Graffiti complaints are more tightly and evenly distributed between the hours 8:00 AM to 16:00 PM. Encampment complaints on the other hand, has a larger peak at 8:00 AM and are slightly more spread out throughout the hours 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM.
								<br>
								Lets investigate the development in the two categories more in depth.
							</p>
							<h2>Development in distribution of Encampment complaints:                        
                            </h2>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								From the plot we see the initial spike in number of complaints at 8:00 AM is arise in the city center. At the same time we see that the drop in number of complaints occur later, around 7:00 PM. From the plot we see that the distribution is stable throughout the day, and the increase in number of complaints arises from a global increase in complaints all over the city. In other words, the increase is not driven by increases in certain geographical locations. Hence, to combat Encampment occurrences our reccomendation is that the efforts should be focused in the city center, since this is where they occur throughout the entire day.
							</p>
							<h2>Development in distribution of Graffiti complaints:                        
                            </h2>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								For the Graffiti complaints we see that distribution throughout the hours 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM is focused in the city center. Additionally we see the drop in complaints at around 4:00 - 5:00 PM. Interestingly, it seems that throughout the evening hours, the number of complaints drop most in the city center, but stay at a higher level in the outer regions of the city, e.g. Golden Gate Park. This might be driven by the fact that people go to the parks in the outer regions of the city during the evening. Contrary to Encampment complaints, which are assumed to be occuring at the time of the complaint, Graffiti complaints can have occurred at any time prior to the complaint. Hence, we cant say with certainty that efforts to combat Graffiti should be focused in the outer regions of the city during the evening hours. But we can say that the higher amount of complaints might indicate a slighty higher than average Graffiti occurences in the outer regions during the evening hours, while taking into consideration that this might be driven by the fact that more people go to these areas during these hours and file the complaints.

							<p style="text-align:justify;">
								For the first time in history, more than 50 percent of the world’s population now lives in towns and cities. By 2050, this number is expected to increase to 66 percent.  
								Urban trees can help to mitigate some of the negative impacts and social consequences of urbanization, and thus make cities more resilient to these changes. Trees provide its citizens shade during the summer, beautify the neighbourhoods, help reduce noise and air pollution, and support urban wildlife.
								Further than these priceless benefits, our urban forest return includes stormwater interception, energy conservation, air pollutant removal, and carbon dioxide storage.  
								Our publicly owned trees are as much of an asset to us as our streets, sewers, bridges, and public buildings.<br><br>


								People in cities live in a constant rush. Hyperconnection through social networks barely let them move the eyes out of the smartphone screen and observe the surroundings. Urban trees are a silent part of the cities' landscape. However, they are certainly unknown for us, but hopefully Data Visualization is going to help us discover some insights, such as:<br>
								- Which are the most common tree species?<br>
								- How are they distributed?<br>
								- How many trees per inhabitant does Barcelona have?<br>
								- Which type of irrigation is nowadays used?<br>
								- Which is the oxygen balance of Barcelona (i.e. trees produced oxygen vs consumed by people)? <br>
					      	</p>
							<br>
							<p style="text-align:justify;">
								Barcelona has as much as <b>203.240</b> urban trees.<br>
								There is a diversity of <b>439</b> different tree species.
								<br>
								<img src="assets/images/trees/trees_wc.png" alt="Trees wordcloud" height="500" width="500">
								<br>
								Barcelona territory is <b>101.3</b>  squared kilometres and the total population in 2019 was <b>1.636.762</b> inhabitants.
								<br>
								According to some estimations, a tree produces around 100 kg of oxygen every year, while each inhabitant consumes around 740 kg of oxygen every year.
								<br>
								Considering these data, Barcelona has a total of <b>2.006</b> trees/square km, the rate of trees per inhabitant is <b>0,12</b> trees/inhabitant and the delta of oxygen (i.e. oxygen produced by trees-oxygen consumed by people) is <b>-1190.88</b> millions of kg.
								<br>

								<br>
								The trees irrigation methods are divided into 6 categories.
								Drip and Hose are the most used methods. Drip was the most installed type, with a big difference, during the years 2010 and 2011. Since then, new trees keep using Drip but the trend went down. Instead, hose usage increased during 2016 and 2017 to drop again in 2018.
								<br>
								The following plot shows the distribution of trees date of planting according to the irrigation type by Year and Year-Month:
								<br>
								<iframe width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~mmestre/7.embed"></iframe>
								<br>
								When comparing trees irrigation type with the tree pit surface or support, drip, sprinkling and diffusion show clear and interesting patterns.
								<br>
								- Drip is mainly used when the Tree pit surface is pavement. It is not the main irrigation type in any other Tree pit surface. Trees in the pavement (probably next to roads or in the streets) need the water in a concrete point and therefore other irrigation types that would spread water in a bigger space cannot be used.
								<br>
								- Sprinkling and diffusion are the main irrigation types when the Tree pit surfaces are grass, grass with vegetation and sandstone with vegetation. Trees in this surfaces are probably in gardens and parks, therefore the irrigation type is probably also irrigating the grass and plants around.
								<br>
								The following plots show the distribution of trees irrigation type according to the tree pit surface or support:

								<br>
								Now, it is time to see which is the relation between the tree specie and the size and edge of the tree pit.
								<br>
								The following plot shows the distribution of tree species according to the pit size:

								<br>
								- Platanus x hispanica is by far the dominating tree specie in the streets of Barcelona. Celtis australis is the second most common tree specie with about half of the total Platanus x hispanica trees.
								<br>
								- Prunus cerasifera is the specie with the highest increase in number of new plantations during the last decade.
								<br>
								- Celtis australis is the specie with the highest decrease in number of new plantations during the last decade.
								<br>
								- October until April are the months where most of the new plantations take place. Summer months register the lowest number of new plantations. High temperatures and people on holidays could be some of the reasons.

								The following plots show the distribution of trees date of planting according to the specie:
