							The goal of this project is to unveil some insights about <b>San Francisco's citizens complaints</b> by using its Open Data. The dataset on which this project is based and its <b>main source</b> can be found <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/311-Cases/vw6y-z8j6" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>, the Open Data portal of SF, full of datasets from the City and County of San Francisco.
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>SF311</b> is the primary customer service center for the City of San Francisco. SF citizens can contact SF311 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, currently via phone, web, mobile, and Twitter.
							<br>
							<br>
							This website is organized in several parts, starting at a general <b>temporal overview</b> of the complaints SF citizens make, its distribution and initial patterns that can be found following a temporal analysis. Some insights are provided regarding relevant events such as the Covid-19.
							<br>
							<br>
							A second section is focused on the development and evolution of complaints regarding <b>temporal-spatial</b> patterns. Using the useful geographical data the dataset contains we are able to plot the location of the complaint, while maintaining temporal information. This allows the user interact and understand the evolution of complaints following different areas of the city and different complaint categories.
							<br>
							<br>
							Lastly, a <b>cluster analysis</b> is made based on machine learning in order to give the user insights on how different neighborhoods in San Fransisco differ when it comes to the distribution of 311 complaints. This allows us to detect similar behavior in different neighborhoods by studying the nature of their complaints. Pretty interesting!
							<br>
							<br>
							Welcome to this journey through the depths of the complaints San Francisco citizens make through SF311. If you are looking for a more detailed analysis and explanation through all the process, the explainer <b>jupyter notebook</b> for this project is available <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sanfranciscodatatrip/sanfranciscodatatrip.github.io/blob/main/final_project_jupyter_notebook/Final_project_SF311.ipynb" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>, but can also be accessed from the orange button in the beginning of the page.

							<h3><b>Visualizing geographical distribution of service complaints.  </b>                      
                            </h3>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								In the following we will be visualizing the geographical distribution of service complaints within different categories. We will be looking at the development of this spatial distribution over years, months and hours, thereby investigating both the spatial and temporal development of the service complaints.
								<br>
								For this purpose we constructed a scatterplot taking the longitude and latitude of each service complaints and plotting these points on map of San Fransisco. When plotting observation we defined two different approaches:
								
							</p>	
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;">1. Sample a fixed number of complaints from each category.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 30px;">2. Sample a fraction of complaints from each category.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">							

								The first approach allows solely for investigation of the development in spatial patterns in the categories over time, whereas the second approach allows us to investigate how the total number of complaints changes during the year, month and hour. Generally a scatterplot is not well suited for visualising count data, but when used in conjunction with the bar plot in part XX, the scatter plot allows us to investigate whether this changes in the total number of complaints is due to local or global changes in the geographical distribution of complaints.
							</p>
							<h2>Focus categories:                        
                            </h2>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								In this part we chose to focus on the categories "Graffiti", "Encampments" and "Tree Maintenance" out of the 101 different categories, to focus our analysis on a few relevant categories. We focused on these specific categories since they cover a diverse set of complaint types in the city of San Fransisco.								
							</p>
							<h2>Notice:                        
                            </h2>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								Due to constraints in upload capacity we were not able to upload the full scatterplots to the website. For that reason, we plot around 1500 fewer samples per category on the website compared to the notebook. For that reason, the highlighted patterns might not be as evident on the website as in the notebook. Please feel free to refer to the notebook for the full size visualisations.
							</p>
							<h3>Investigating yearly patterns</h3>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">

								Lets start by investigating the yearly pattern for the three categories...
								<br>
								<iframe width="950" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~mmestre/13.embed"></iframe>
								<br>
								Overall 'Encampments' and 'Graffiti' occurs mostly in the city center. Interestingly however, we see that both 'Graffiti' and 'Encampments' occur more often in the outer regions of the city in the early years of 2009-2011 compared to the later years 2018-2019. For instance, in the southern region of SF there is a cluster of 'Graffiti' complaints in the early years, which is almost completely dissolved by 2015.
								<br>
								Based on this development we can say that 'Graffiti' and 'Encampments' are most likely to occur in the city center of SF. Hence, future efforts to reduce the number of complaints for these categories should be geographically focused at the city center.
								<br>
								'Tree Maintenance' complaints are more evenly distributed across the city and remain so over the years. Hence, there is no clear change in the spatial pattern of this complaint type over the years.
								<br>
								Lets zoom in and investigate developments in the geographical distribution on a monthly basis.
							</p>
							<h3>Investigating monthly patterns                      
                            </h3>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								When investigating the barplot in part <b>XX</b> we noticed some kind of "beginning-of-year-effect" in the distribution of 'Graffity' complaints. Every January-February the amount of complaints increase suddenly and keep increasing throughout March-April after which the amount of complaints drop again until it reaches its low in December. This effect is particularly evident in the years 2016-2019, so we will focus on these years in the following.
								<br>
								Lets see if this trend is due to changes in local or global trends in the geographical distribution of complaints...
								<br>
								<iframe width="950" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~mmestre/19.embed"></iframe>
								<br>
								<b>Graffiti</b> in the plot we see that "beginning-of-year-effect" results in a global increase the number of complaints. We only see a small increase in local complaint count, for instance the southern area of the city where we just identified a cluster back in the previous section.
								<br>
								All in all, the spatial pattern is very similar and the overall increase in 'Graffiti' complaints is not driven by any local increase. Graffiti complaints are still most prevalent in the city center throughout the months of the year. Hence, to address the increase in the number of 'Graffiti', the city should implement initiatives focused on the city center.
								<br>
								Lets now zoom in once again and investigate the development in the geographical distribution over the hours of the day...
							</p>
							<h3>Investigating daily patterns                      
                            </h3>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">								
								<iframe width="950" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~mmestre/24.embed"></iframe>
								<br>
							</p>
							<h2>Overall development:                        
                            </h2>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								In the plot we see the daily cycle of the number of complaints for the categories of 'Graffiti' and 'Encampments'. We chose to focus on these categories after investigating the distribution of 'Tree Maintenance', where we found no interesting pattern. Additionally, this helps limit the size of the plot for efficient integration into the website.
								<br>					
								Overall, we see that during the first hours of the day (the night) there is few complaints in all categories. As we approach the 7:00 AM, and people start going to work, we see a steep increase in the number of complaints in all categories. From 7:00 until Noon the number of complaints keep increasing. As we approach 16:00-17:00 PM we see a large decrease in the number of complaints across all categories. By 11:00 PM the number of complaints is at a low point and stays there throughout the night.
								<br>
								This pattern, arising from the natural rythm of our society, is of cause to be expected.
								<br>
								When plotting the distribution of complaints over the hours for each category in the previous section, we found that Graffiti complaints are more tightly and evenly distributed between the hours 8:00 AM to 16:00 PM. Encampment complaints on the other hand, has a larger peak at 8:00 AM and are slightly more spread out throughout the hours 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM.
								<br>
								Lets investigate the development in the two categories more in depth.
							</p>
							<h2>Development in distribution of Encampment complaints:                        
                            </h2>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								From the plot we see the initial spike in number of complaints at 8:00 AM is arise in the city center. At the same time we see that the drop in number of complaints occur later, around 7:00 PM. From the plot we see that the distribution is stable throughout the day, and the increase in number of complaints arises from a global increase in complaints all over the city. In other words, the increase is not driven by increases in certain geographical locations. Hence, to combat Encampment occurrences our reccomendation is that the efforts should be focused in the city center, since this is where they occur throughout the entire day.
							</p>
							<h2>Development in distribution of Graffiti complaints:                        
                            </h2>
                            <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">
								For the Graffiti complaints we see that distribution throughout the hours 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM is focused in the city center. Additionally we see the drop in complaints at around 4:00 - 5:00 PM. Interestingly, it seems that throughout the evening hours, the number of complaints drop most in the city center, but stay at a higher level in the outer regions of the city, e.g. Golden Gate Park. This might be driven by the fact that people go to the parks in the outer regions of the city during the evening. Contrary to Encampment complaints, which are assumed to be occuring at the time of the complaint, Graffiti complaints can have occurred at any time prior to the complaint. Hence, we cant say with certainty that efforts to combat Graffiti should be focused in the outer regions of the city during the evening hours. But we can say that the higher amount of complaints might indicate a slighty higher than average Graffiti occurences in the outer regions during the evening hours, while taking into consideration that this might be driven by the fact that more people go to these areas during these hours and file the complaints.

							<b>The different types of neighborhoods in San Fransico</b>
							</h3>


							<h2>
							The Parks and Recreations of San fransico
							</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">							
							- We start by diving into <b>Cluster 6</b>, so go and unpick all other clusters in the barplot. If you hover over the map, you see that this cluster consists of three park neighborhoods so naturally the majority of concerns and requests about Parks and Recreations. In fact, if you hover over the 'Rec and Park Requests' in the barplot it is seen that about 57 % of all request of this type is in this cluster. Another concern is the homeless who might favor seeking shelter in parks.
							<br>
							- <b>Cluster 7</b> includes the neighborhood Presidio, a big park area where the Golden Gate Bridge connects and it includes Lakeshore, a nice area with a lake, park and the zoo! Here you will, as in <b>Cluster 6</b>, have many people with requests about parks and recreation, but instead of homeless concerns people in <b>Cluster 7</b> complain about street defects and sign repair. People in this cluster also provides lot of feedback for the puplic transport system MUNI, which might stem from tourists or visitors travelling to these areas by puplic transportation.
							<br>
							<br>
							</p>

							<h2>
							The odd ones out
							</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">							
							- The neighborhood 'Seacliff' is the singleton <b>Cluster 9</b>. It sepearates itself from other neighborhoods because it has extraordinary high frequency of complaints regarding 'Abandoned Vehicles'.
							<br>
							- <b>Cluster 10</b> consists solely of 'Treasure Island', a small artificial Island that according to 311 data has biggest problems with 'Streetlights' and 'Sewers Issues'. Almost 30 % of all streetlight complaints are from here. Again you can see a cluster that provides loads of 'Muni Feedback'.
							<br>
							<br>
							</p>

							The crowded and busy city center

							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">							
							- Now we go into the areas around the city center which is <b>Cluster 3</b> and <b>Cluster 5</b>. The complaints and request in these two clusters are almost the same but with slight differences. Both cluster struggle with homeless people and together these two clusters have almost 50% of all 'Homeless Concerns' and over 60% of all 'Encampment' complaints. The complaint types here are reflected by the fact that theese neighborhoods are very active and crowded with commercial areas, bars and buisness areas, so you see many complaints about noise, litter, damaged property, blocked traffic, cleanliness BUT no abandoned vehicle.
							<br>
							- Another cluster in the center of San Fransisco is <b>Cluster 4</b>, which you can see on the map consist of three small neighborhoods including Chinatown. In constrast to <b>Cluster 3</b> and <b>Cluster 5</b> the cluster doesn't struggle with encampments and homeless, but has about the same amount of complaints about 'Graffiti' and 'Illegal Posting' as <b>Cluster 5</b> eventhough <b>Cluster 4</b> accounts for way less 311 recuests in total.
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2>
							The outskirt of the center
							</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 0px;">							
							- <b>Cluster 8</b> represents a big number of neighborhoods in the outskirts of the center and account for a big chunk of all requests in all categories.. In contrast to the more crammed and busy clusters 3 and 5, that contains more deserted areas where poeple dump their cars. You can see in the barplot that 41 % of the total amount of 'Abandoned Vehicles' are found in this cluster. Other notable complaints are about the 'Sewer Issues' and 'Tree maintainance' but the cluster represents.
							<br>
							- You can also see <b>Cluster 1</b> on the map as three spread out chunks of neighborhoods in the outer areas of San Fransisco. If you come to these areas of town you will experience issues within all categories but the need for 'Parking Enforcement' might stand out!
							<br>
							- Lastly you can see that <b>Cluster 2</b> is a collection of neighborhoods by they Bay. This includes the neighborhood Portola wherein the office of San Francisco Housing Authority lies, hence the overhwelming amount of 'SFHA requests'. Otherwise you can experience a broad palette of issues, just as in <b>Cluster 1</b>.
